Msisdn is a .NET library that facilitates working with international telephone numbers in F#. It follows the [ITU-T](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-T) recommendation [E.164](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164).

Features:

* Provides a type for representing phone numbers. A value of this type will ALWAYS be a valid phone number (it may not exist, but it will be valid).
* Validates MSISDN strings
* Normalizes MSISDN strings to its canonical representation
* Lets you extract country calling code and country name from Msisdn

## Install with NuGet

    PM> Install-Package FSharp.Msisdn

## Usage

You create an Msisdn by providing a string describing the phone number, including country calling code prefix, to the `create` function.

	// Create a fictitious Norwegian mobile number
    match Msisdn.create "4799999999" with
    | Some msisdn -> doSomethingWith msisdn
    | None -> printfn "Not a valid MSISDN"

Note that you don't have to (actually you're not allowed to) open the Msisdn module. The module will automatically be available everywhere in a project referencing FSharp.Msisdn, but you have to use qualified access.

## Msisdn module API

### T

	type T = Msisdn of string

A single case discriminated union wrapping a phone number string. YOU DON'T NEED TO REFER TO THIS TYPE DIRECTLY, AND SHOULD NOT DO SO.

### create

    val create : string -> T option

Creates an Msisdn option. If s is a valid number, returns `Some Msisdn.T`. If not valid, returns `None`. `null` is never a valid number.

By using an option type, `create` forces the caller to handle the case of invalid input, which is a good thing!

`create` will strip away and ignore certain characters normally found in human representations of phone numbers. These are all valid inputs:

    "47 99 99 99 99"   // spaces are ok
    "0047 99999999"    // leading zeros are ok
    "+47 999-99-999"   // plus and hyphens are ok
    "[47](999){99999}" // brackets are ok
    "47\t99999999\r\n" // even tabs and newlines are ok

### apply

    val apply : (string -> 'a) -> T -> 'a

Apply function f to the canonical string representation of an Msisdn.

### value

    val value : T -> string

Get the canonical string representation of an Msisdn.

When you retrieve the value from an Msisdn, the canonical string representation is given:

    Msisdn.create "0047 (999) 99-999"
    |> Option.get
    |> Msisdn.value // evaluates to "4799999999"

### isValid

    val isValid : string -> bool

Checks if string is a valid input for an Msisdn.
Verification is done for you when you create
a new Msisdn using the `create` function.

### canonicalize

    val canonicalize : string -> string

Transforms a valid Msisdn string to its canonical form.
This is done for you when you create a new Msisdn using
the `create` function.

### equals

    val equals : T -> T -> bool

### compareTo

    val compareTo : T -> T -> int

### countryCode

    val countryCode : T -> string * string

Get the country calling code prefix (CC) and the country or destination name
from an Msisdn.

    let cc, description = Msisdn.create "+4799999999"
                          |> Option.get
                          |> Msisdn.countryCode
    // val cc = "47"
    // val description = "Norway"

CC will always be between 1 and 3 digits. The same CC will in some situations have different descriptions.

    ["90 312 213 2965"
     "90 392 11111"]
    |> List.map (Option.map Msisdn.countryCode)

    // Result:
    // [("90", "Turkey")
        ("90", "Northern Cyprus")]

## More examples

This is how you may use FSharp.Msisdn to get the canonical representation from a list potensially containing some invalid numbers:

    let numbers = ["47 91 92 93 94"
                   "1-555-32-654"
                   "00362347657"
                   "+87899877889x"]
    
    numbers
    |> List.map Msisdn.create
    |> List.choose (Option.map Msisdn.value)

    // Result:
    // ["4791929394"; "155532654"; "362347657"]

Of course the same thing can be done using `canonicalize` and `isValid` directly:

    numbers
    |> List.map Msisdn.canonicalize
    |> List.filter Msisdn.isValid

If you need to group your numbers by country code, you could do something like this:

    numbers
    |> List.map Msisdn.create
    |> List.choose id
    |> Seq.groupBy 
        (fun x -> let cc, _ = Msisdn.countryCode x in cc)
    
    // Result:
    // [("47", seq [Msisdn "4791929394"])
    //  ("1", seq [Msisdn "155532654"])
    //  ("36", seq [Msisdn "362347657"])]
